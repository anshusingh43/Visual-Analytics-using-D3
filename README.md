# Visual-Analytics-using-D3
In this repository, you will find some examples of visual analysis using D3 programming language.

This repository is created to show you how you can use D3 for your visualization. The first example starts from very basic of text visualization adn then went on to some shapes formation, buliding scatterplot, bar graphs and some customized actions on them. 

I will explain all the exercises and the code ( if needed ) so that you can replicate it wihtout any doubts.

Hope you enjoy this little help from my side to you.
