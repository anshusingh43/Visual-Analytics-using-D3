//keep the changes after each task
//task 1: Change d3.select("#div2")	to d3.select("#div1") and see how the html page will be changed. --> it is showing 2 red text which is showing me the extra text from the d2 after the enter is processed. Enter will bind extra 2 from d2 into paragraph and append them so that is why we see only 2 not 6.		
//task 2: (a) change var arr = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] to var arr = [1, 1] --> just the green one showing because there is no extra to get appended.
// and (b) change .enter() to .exit() and (c) remove .append("p"), then see how the html page will be changed. 
//task 3: remove .exit() and see how the html page will be changed.
